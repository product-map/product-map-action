# product-map-action
**ProductMap Action** is a GitHub Actions extension designed to automate file processing and analysis using 
[ProductMap](https://product-map.ai). This action seamlessly integrates into your GitHub workflow to analyze a specified set of files and 
generate corresponding **analysis result URLs**.

Once processed, these URLs are automatically appended to the end of the **README.md** file, ensuring that results 
are accessible directly from the repository.

## How It Works
1. Detects changes in specified files within the public repository.
2. Processes the modified files using **ProductMap**.
3. Generates **public URLs** for the analysis results.
4. Appends the generated URLs to the **README.md** file.
5. Creates a new branch with the updated **README.md** and submits a **pull request** to merge the changes.

The following inputs must be provided for the action to function correctly within a GitHub workflow:

Input	Description
github_token	Required. The GitHub token to access the repository.
expected_files	Required. A list of file paths that the action should monitor and process when modified.
user_email	Optional. The email address associated with your ProductMap account, used to link the files to your profile.

## Inputs

The following inputs must be provided for the action to function correctly within a GitHub workflow:

| Input           | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `github_token`  | ‚úÖ Yes  | The GitHub token to access the repository. |
| `expected_files` | ‚úÖ Yes  | A list of file paths that the action should monitor and process when modified. |
| `user_email`    | ‚úÖ Yes | The email address associated with your **ProductMap** account, used to link the files to your profile. |


Below is an example of how to use the action in your workflow file:
```yaml
...
steps:
  - name: ProductMap Map Generation
    # uses: JuanQuGo/product-map-action@latest
    uses: JuanQuGo/product-map-action@<latest-version>
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      expected_files: ("<your-file-path>", "<another/file-path>")
      user_email: <your@email.com>
...
```

## Outputs

Upon execution, the action generates the following outputs:

| Output         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Public URLs** | A list of **ProductMap** public URLs for the processed files. These URLs allow you to access the analysis results. |

## Where Are These Outputs Stored?
- The public URLs are appended to the end of the repository's README.md file.
- The action automatically creates a new branch with the updated README.md.
- A pull request is opened to merge the changes into the main branch.
